            <p>Our primary concern is the safety of our users! We have therefore
            put in place the following safety mechanisms before, during,
            and after the use of Spare Rides.</p>

            <h4 class="orange">Before your trip:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <u>Facebook Verification</u>. To use Spare Rides, person should 
                    have a valid Facebook profile. We will pull both profile 
                    picture and full name in order to verify that this is a real 
                    person. In addition to this, Facebook does their own verification 
                    of their users.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <u>Phone Number Verification</u>. We also store the phone number in our 
                    database to keep a full historical record of all users.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <u>Credit card information</u> which we verify through the trusted payment processing company <a href="stripe.com">Stripe</a>.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h4 class="orange">During your trip:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <u>GPS location</u> of both driver and rider is tracked at all times and recorded on our system. 
                    We have full access to this information during the trip but also after the trip has been completed.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <u>One-touch access to customer service phone number</u> which we are
                     manning during your trip and service hours.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h4 class="orange">After your trip:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                  <u>Rating and review</u>. Both the driver and the rider are prompted to review one another. We always follow up if there are any issues.

                </li>
                <li>
                  <u>Direct feedback</u>. Users will be able to send any comments about their trip directly to us after each trip and report about any issues. 
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="faq-question-title" id="spare-with-icbc-insurance">How does this work with my ICBC insurance?</h3>

            <p>Under the Section 55 of the Regulations under BC Law, as long as you
            respect the terms of your Autoplan contract and use your vehicle
            for leisure purposes, you are within the law.</p>

            <p>With regards to ridesharing, <a class="purple" href="http://drivesmartbc.ca/miscellaneous/carpooling-makes-sense">
            documentation around Carpooling</a> suggests that:</p>

            <p><i>"If money is given to offset the cost, a vehicle owner may
              insure their vehicle in the rate class for its normal use,
              provided that their passengers’ contributions do not exceed
              the cost of fuel, insurance, wear and tear, and/or parking
              for the trip and don’t include expenses for depreciation of
              their vehicle. Their vehicle will only need to be rated for
              business use if they start gaining financially from driving
              passengers."</i></p>

            <p>For as long as you use Spare Rides' services non-commercially
              (as per our Terms &amp; Conditions) to offset your costs of
              driving, you should adhere to the same policies as carpooling.</p>

            <p>We strongly recommend you check with your Autoplan dealer the
              terms of your insurance contract, to ensure you have sufficient
              insurance to take several riders at once.</p>

            <p>If you are a BC vehicle owner, <a href="http://drivesmartbc.ca/miscellaneous/carpooling-makes-sense">
              ICBC's basic coverage</a> has a few mandatory protections in place
              that cover you in the event of an accident:</p>

            <h4 class="orange">Third Party Liability</h4>
            <p><i>Protects you when you're at fault in a crash and another
              motorist makes a claim against you. Your Basic Autoplan covers
              up to $200,000 of their injury costs and vehicle damage.</i></p>

            <h4 class="orange">Autoplan Accident Benefits</h4>
            <p><i>Help you, your passengers and members of your household
              with medical costs, wage loss and more if you’re injured in a
              motor vehicle crash, even if you’re at fault.</i></p>

            <p><i>Accident Benefits provide up to $150,000 in medical and
              rehabilitation costs. This could include costs like hospital
              care, chiropractic treatments, dental care, medication,
              physiotherapy, medical equipment and more.</i></p>

            <p><b>While ICBC's minimum liability coverage is $200,000,
              we recommend a minimum third party liability coverage of
              $2 million to be extra safe if you're going to be taking
              passengers. You can easily increase your liability limit
              by talking to your Autoplan dealer.</b></p>


            <h3 class="faq-question-title" id="trust-spare-for-daily-commute">Why should I trust Spare for my daily commute?</h3>
            <p>We work hard to make sure that you have the best commuting experience possible during your trip. 
              Here are several reasons why you can trust Spare for your daily commute:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Spare uses smart algorithms to offer you best matching options for fast and convenient trip with minimum detour.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <u>You only tell us your regular commuting time and destination.</u> That’s it! We will take care of the rest and 
                  notify you when we find matches for your trip so you can review and accept them. Simple and fun! 
                </li>
                <li>We notify our drivers and riders about <u>all details of the trip in advance</u>. 
                  We also send them notifications one hour before to make sure that both rider 
                  and driver will not forget about the trip. 
                </li>
                <li><u>Riders can track driver’s route</u> and know exactly when the driver arrives. This also ensures that the rider 
                will be ready for pick-up when the driver arrives. 
            </li>
              <li>Guaranteed payment. Spare has cancellation policy that ensures that the driver and the 
                rider will make the trip in case if the trip was scheduled and has not been cancelled 12 
                hours before. If any party doesn’t not show up for the trip, other party gets refund equal to the cost of the trip. 
                </li>
                <li>We have serious <a class="purple" href="#how-does-app-ensure-safety">safety mechanisms</a> as we want to make sure that your
                   commuting experience will not be only fun but also safe.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="faq-question-title" id="spare-community">Spare Community</h3>
            <p>Carpooling is not only a sustainable and convenient alternative to traditional transit but it is also a good option to socialize without
               changing your daily routine and plans. Spare strives to create a community of people joined by a common idea of making
                Vancouver better place to live by sharing their daily commute. <br /><br />

            <p>Spare works hard to provide our users with the best commuting experience, however,

                  </li>
                <li>
                   Choose whether you are a rider or a driver.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <u>If you are a rider</u>, enter your credit card information, home and work address and create a recurring trip for scheduling your weekly commute.
                </li>

                <li>Wait to be matched with awesome people!</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="faq-question-title" id="what-is-recurring-trip">What is a recurring trip?</h3>
            <p>Recurring trip allows you to schedule your commute one week ahead. 
              It is a convenient option for those who have regular commuting time and 
              destination. If you don’t have regular commuting time and destination, you 
              can still create a one-time trip. </p>

            <h3 class="faq-question-title" id="what-happens-after-create-trip">What happens after I create my trip?</h3>
            <p>After you create your trip, Spare starts searching best matching 
              options for you. As soon as we find them, the app sends you notification 
              (make sure that you allow us to send you notifications). After you get
               matched, you can see more details about the trips and make offers to
                join them.</p>

            <h2 class="faq-section-header">Getting Matched</h4>

            <h3 class="faq-question-title" id="how-do-know-match">How do I know that I got matched?</h3>
            <p>As soon as you get matched, we will send you notification about it.
               After you receive notification, you can go to the app to see more
                details about the match. Make sure that your notification option is turned on. </p>

            <h3 class="faq-question-title" id="what-to-do-after-match">What should I do after I get matched?</h3>
            <p>You can see more details about the matches and decide if you want to offer a ride/drive to
              your match one time or multiple days. 
              Your match gets notified about your offer and accepts or declines the offer. If they accept the 
              offer, your trip will automatically be scheduled and confirmed. If they decline the offer, 
              the match will disappear in your offer window and you can offer a ride/drive to 
              other people. <br /><br />

              NOTE: If you have multiple matches, you can still offer a ride/drive to all of them. 
              Your trip will be scheduled with the person who accepted first.</p>

            <h3 class="faq-question-title" id="know-more-about-trip">How do I know more about my trip?</h3>
            <p>You can tap on the profile picture of the match to get more details 
              including route (for drivers) and price and car make for riders.</p>

            <h3 class="faq-question-title" id="what-happens-when-accept">What happens if I accept a trip offer?</h3>
            <p>Accepting the offer means that you confirm the route, time and cost 
              of the trip and ready to take the trip. The confirmation is automatically 
              sent to your match and they get ready to take the trip. <br /> <br />

                You can still cancel the accepted offer in case if you change your mind. 
                If you cancel your scheduled trip 12 hours before the trip, there is
                 no penalty for cancellation. If you cancel the scheduled trip in
                  less than 12 hours, there is a penalty equal to the cost of the trip. </p>

            <h3 class="faq-question-title" id="what-happens-when-reject">What happens if I reject a trip offer?</h3>
            <p>If you reject the offer, your match gets notified that you are not interested
               in this trip. This match will automatically disappear from the match screen. </p>

            <h2 class="faq-section-header">Taking a Trip</h4>

            <h3 class="faq-question-title" id="what-happens-on-day-of-trip">What happens on the day of the trip?</h3>
            <p>Congratulations! Looks like you found a match and confirmed your trip! Now you have the most exciting part – meeting your match! Don’t forget to check the trip time in advance to make sure that you are not late. Just in case, one hour before the trip we will send you a reminder. 
            <br /><br />
            <b>If you are a driver</b>, open your trip window in the app, it will show you where to go and time when the rider expects your pick-up. 
            <br /><br />
            <b>If you are a rider</b>, you can track the driver’s location in your trip window. Please, make sure to be ready for a pick-up at the scheduled time. 
            <br /><br />
            Your commute just officially got fun! Enjoy the nice conversation and your trip! 
            </p>

            <h3 class="faq-question-title" id="should-i-contact-to-confirm">Should I contact my driver/rider to confirm the trip?</h3>
            <p>It is not necessary to contact your driver/rider to confirm the trip. As soon as you 
              confirm the trip in the app, other party gets notified about the details of upcoming trip 
              and gets ready for it. If other party cancels the trip, you will get a notification about it.     
            </p>

            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>We offer drivers shortest route with minimum detour to make sure that the trip will be as fast as possible.</li>
                <li>We notify our drivers and riders about all details of the trip in advance to decrease the chances of not showing-up or 
being late. </li>
                <li>We allow riders track the driver’s route and know exactly when the driver arrives. 
                  This also ensures that the rider will be ready for pick-up when the driver arrives. </li>
                <li>We have guaranteed payments in case of no-show up or late cancellation.
                   If any party cancels the trip in less than 12 hours or doesn’t 
                   show up for the trip, other party gets guaranteed payment equal to the cost of the trip. </li>
                <li>We have serious safety mechanisms as we want to make sure that your 
                  commuting experience will not only be fun but also safe.</li>
                <li>We encourage people to network and socialize during the trip which turns your 
                  traditional passive hours of commute into fun part of the day.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="faq-question-title" id="should-i-contact-if-late">Should I contact the driver/rider if I am late?</h3>
            <p>We strongly encourage our users to plan their trips and possible traffic 
              congestions and be on time. In case if you are late, we recommend 
              you to call and inform the rider/driver about it.      
            </p>

            <h3 class="faq-question-title" id="what-if-driver-does-not-show-up">What if my driver/rider does not show up?</h3>
            <p>For riders:  If your driver will not show up, you get 100% refund of your trip cost. <br />
For drivers:  if your rider will not show up, you still get 100% of your trip cost.      
            </p>

            <h3 class="faq-question-title" id="what-if-need-to-cancel">What if I need to cancel my trip?</h3>
            <p>If you cancel your trip 12 hours before the trip time, there is no penalty associated
               with the cancellation. If you cancel your trip within 12 hours, there is a penalty
                equal to the cost of the trip.      
            </p>

            <h2 class="faq-section-header">Completing a Trip</h4>

            <h3 class="faq-question-title" id="can-rate-driver-rider">Can I rate the rider/driver?</h3>
            <p>Yes, after you complete your trip, you can rate your rider and driver.   
            </p>

            <h3 class="faq-question-title" id="can-make-trip-with-same-person">Can I take a trip with the same person multiple times?</h3>
            <p>Yes, there are no limits in number of offers to the same person.  
            </p>

            <h3 class="faq-question-title" id="how-do-i-pay">How do I pay/get paid?</h3>
            <p>All payments are processed online and there is no cash exchange. When trip 
              completes, driver automatically receives the payment on his bank account. <br /><br />
              If you are a driver, Spare does payouts directly to your Bank Account. Around one week 
              after your drive, if required bank account information is provided, Spare will deposit 
              directly into your bank account. To set this up go to <b>Settings → Bank Account</b> and provide 
              us with the necessary information. Spare uses the safe and secure, PCI-DSS compliant service,
              Stripe to handle all payment transactions.  
            </p>

            <h2 class="faq-section-header">Pricing</h4>

            <h3 class="faq-question-title" id="how-does-pricing-work">How does Spare calculate the cost of the trip?</h3>
            <p>Spare has dynamic pricing mechanism which depends on the distance of the trip. As an example,
               approximate cost of the trip from UBC to downtown (8km) is $4.85, trip 
               cost from Metrotown Burnaby to downtown Vancouver (12km) is $7.
