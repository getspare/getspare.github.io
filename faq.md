## Frequently Asked Questions

#### Why would I use Spare Rides?

We are filling spare seats ðŸš£ with a fun journey, every day ðŸ™Œ!
  Spare Rides is a new innovative app that is changing the way people
  commute. It allows you to share your commute with people traveling
  in a similar direction. Riders get matched with drivers within the app
  and pay for a portion of the cost of the trip. This allows for a more
  social ðŸ˜Ž, sustainable ðŸŒ¼ and affordable ðŸ’¸ way to commute!

#### Where does this work?
Spare is live in all of Metro Vancouver.  Set up your trip schedule today
  and we will match you with awesome people.  If you would like us to expand our service to a certain
  location, let us know -
  we might be heading your way ðŸ˜œ

#### How do you keep drivers/riders safe?
Our primary concern is the safety of our users! We have therefore
put in place the following safety mechanisms before, during,
and after the use of Spare Rides.

#### Before using Spare Rides:
  1. To use Spare Rides, you first need to log in with Facebook.
        This ensures us that the person has a valid Facebook profile.
        We will pull both profile picture and full name, in order to
        verify that this is a real person. In addition to this,
        Facebook does their own verification of their users.

   2. We verify usersâ€™ phone numbers, giving us a direct line to
        the user. We also store the phone number in our database,
        to keep a full historical record of all users.

   3. Riders need to enter in their credit card information,
        which we verify through the trusted payment processing
        company Stripe.


#### While using Spare Rides:

 1. The GPS location of both driver and rider is tracked at
        all times and recorded on our system.
        We have full access to this information during the trip,
        but also after the trip has been completed.

  2. The rider and driver have a one-touch access to
        calling our Spare Rides customer phone number, which we
        are manning during service hours.

#### After using Spare Rides:

  1.  Both the driver and the rider are prompted to review one
        another, giving us a way to follow up if there are any
        problems.

 2. We have full control of who is permitted into the system.
        If we deem that a user is misusing the system, we will
        be able to ban the user from further using the system.

  3. Users will be able to send any comments about their trip
        directly to us after each trip, so that we can follow up
        with any negative experiences in using Spare Rides as
         quickly as possible.

#### How does this work with my ICBC insurance?

Under the Section 55 of the Regulations under BC Law, as long as you
respect the terms of your Autoplan contract and use your vehicle
for leisure purposes, you are within the law.

With regards to ridesharing, [documentation around Carpooling](http://drivesmartbc.ca/miscellaneous/carpooling-makes-sense) suggests that:

*"If money is given to offset the cost, a vehicle owner may
  insure their vehicle in the rate class for its normal use,
  provided that their passengersâ€™ contributions do not exceed
  the cost of fuel, insurance, wear and tear, and/or parking
  for the trip and donâ€™t include expenses for depreciation of
  their vehicle. Their vehicle will only need to be rated for
  business use if they start gaining financially from driving
  passengers."*

For as long as you use Spare Rides' services non-commercially
  (as per our Terms &amp; Conditions) to offset your costs of
  driving, you should adhere to the same policies as carpooling.

We strongly recommend you check with your Autoplan dealer the
  terms of your insurance contract, to ensure you have sufficient
  insurance to take several riders at once.

If you are a BC vehicle owner, [ICBC's basic coverage](http://drivesmartbc.ca/miscellaneous/carpooling-makes-sense)
has a few mandatory protections in place that cover you in the event of an accident:

#### Third Party Liability
*Protects you when you're at fault in a crash and another
  motorist makes a claim against you. Your Basic Autoplan covers
  up to $200,000 of their injury costs and vehicle damage.*

#### Autoplan Accident Benefits
*Help you, your passengers and members of your household
  with medical costs, wage loss and more if youâ€™re injured in a
  motor vehicle crash, even if youâ€™re at fault.*

*Accident Benefits provide up to $150,000 in medical and
  rehabilitation costs. This could include costs like hospital
  care, chiropractic treatments, dental care, medication,
  physiotherapy, medical equipment and more..*

**While ICBC's minimum liability coverage is $200,000,
  we recommend a minimum third party liability coverage of
  $2 million to be extra safe if you're going to be taking
  passengers. You can easily increase your liability limit
  by talking to your Autoplan dealer.**

#### How do I get paid as a Driver?
Spare does payouts directly to your Bank Account.  Around one
    week after your drive, if required bank account information is
    provided, Spare will deposit directly into your bank account.
    To set this up go to Settings &#8594; Bank Account
    and provide us with
    the necessary information.  Spare uses the safe and secure, PCI-DSS
    compliant service, Stripe to handle all payment transactions.

#### How do I redeem a coupon code?
To redeem a coupon code within the app go to
  Settings &#8594; Account Credits. Your account balance will
  update automatically.
