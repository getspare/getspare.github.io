## Frequently Asked Questions

#### Why would I use Spare Rides?

We are filling spare seats ðŸš£ with a fun journey, every day ðŸ™Œ!
Spare Rides is a new innovative app that is changing the way people
commute. It provides real-time commute-sharing with people travelling
in the same direction. Riders get matched with drivers within the app
and pay for a portion of the cost of the trip, this allows for a more
social ðŸ˜Ž, sustainable ðŸŒ¼ and affordable ðŸ’¸ way to commute!

#### What will I pay as a rider?
Our pricing is very simple, only $1.50 in base
fare and $0.50 per kilometer. For example, if you are travelling
4.9 km, you will be charged $3.85 for
the ride. Be part of the sharing community ðŸ’ª !

Spare Rides is a great way to commute. You make a new friend,
it is twice the speed of transit (yay to not waiting at the
bus stop ðŸ™Œ), and it compares really well to other commuting
options in Vancouver.

#### How much will I make as a driver?
We know driving a car is expensive ðŸ’°! Did you know that, on
average, it costs over $8,000 to own and drive a car in
Canada ðŸš—. As a driver using Spare Rides, you will make
$1.00 in base fare and $0.35 per kilometer
for the rider you pick up. For example, if a rider needs to go
just over 11 km, you will be making $5
for each rider. Be part of the sharing community ðŸ’ª !


#### Where does this work?

As a rider, we currently operate the service exclusively in
Vancouver between 1st and 16th, UBC and Commercial during commuting hours (weekdays 8 AM to 11 AM,
and 3 PM to 6 PM). If you would like us to expand our service
to a certain location, [let us know](contact) - we might be heading your way ðŸ˜œ.

As a driver, you can use Spare Rides anywhere, but pickup and
dropoff of riders are only open within the Spare Rides Zone during commuting hours (weekdays 8 AM to
11 AM, and 3 PM to 6 PM). The service therefore works best if
you are driving for at least 5 km through the Spare Rides Zone.
If you would like us to expand our service to a certain
location, [let us know](contact) -
we might be heading your way ðŸ˜œ.


#### How do you keep drivers/riders safe?
Our primary concern is the safety of our users! We have therefore
put in place the following safety mechanisms before, during,
and after the use of Spare Rides.

#### Before using Spare Rides:
  1. To use Spare Rides, you first need to log in with Facebook.
        This ensures us that the person has a valid Facebook profile.
        We will pull both profile picture and full name, in order to
        verify that this is a real person. In addition to this,
        Facebook does their own verification of their users.

   2. We verify usersâ€™ phone numbers, giving us a direct line to
        the user. We also store the phone number in our database,
        to keep a full historical record of all users.

   3. Riders need to enter in their credit card information,
        which we verify through the trusted payment processing
        company Stripe.


#### While using Spare Rides:

 1. The GPS location of both driver and rider is tracked at
        all times and recorded on our system.
        We have full access to this information during the trip,
        but also after the trip has been completed.

  2. The rider and driver have a one-touch access to
        calling our Spare Rides customer phone number, which we
        are manning during service hours.

#### After using Spare Rides:

  1.  Both the driver and the rider are prompted to review one
        another, giving us a way to follow up if there are any
        problems.

 2. We have full control of who is permitted into the system.
        If we deem that a user is misusing the system, we will
        be able to ban the user from further using the system.

  3. Users will be able to send any comments about their trip
        directly to us after each trip, so that we can follow up
        with any negative experiences in using Spare Rides as
         quickly as possible.

#### How does this work with my ICBC insurance?

Under the Section 55 of the Regulations under BC Law, as long as you
respect the terms of your Autoplan contract and use your vehicle
for leisure purposes, you are within the law.

With regards to ridesharing, [documentation around Carpooling](http://drivesmartbc.ca/miscellaneous/carpooling-makes-sense) suggests that:

*"If money is given to offset the cost, a vehicle owner may
  insure their vehicle in the rate class for its normal use,
  provided that their passengersâ€™ contributions do not exceed
  the cost of fuel, insurance, wear and tear, and/or parking
  for the trip and donâ€™t include expenses for depreciation of
  their vehicle. Their vehicle will only need to be rated for
  business use if they start gaining financially from driving
  passengers."*

For as long as you use Spare Rides' services non-commercially
  (as per our Terms &amp; Conditions) to offset your costs of
  driving, you should adhere to the same policies as carpooling.

We strongly recommend you check with your Autoplan dealer the
  terms of your insurance contract, to ensure you have sufficient
  insurance to take several riders at once.

If you are a BC vehicle owner, [ICBC's basic coverage](http://drivesmartbc.ca/miscellaneous/carpooling-makes-sense)
has a few mandatory protections in place that cover you in the event of an accident:

#### Third Party Liability
*Protects you when you're at fault in a crash and another
  motorist makes a claim against you. Your Basic Autoplan covers
  up to $200,000 of their injury costs and vehicle damage.*

#### Autoplan Accident Benefits
*Help you, your passengers and members of your household
  with medical costs, wage loss and more if youâ€™re injured in a
  motor vehicle crash, even if youâ€™re at fault.*

*Accident Benefits provide up to $150,000 in medical and
  rehabilitation costs. This could include costs like hospital
  care, chiropractic treatments, dental care, medication,
  physiotherapy, medical equipment and more..*

**While ICBC's minimum liability coverage is $200,000,
  we recommend a minimum third party liability coverage of
  $2 million to be extra safe if you're going to be taking
  passengers. You can easily increase your liability limit
  by talking to your Autoplan dealer.**

#### How do I redeem a coupon code?
To redeem a coupon code within the app go to
  Settings &#8594; Account Credits. Your account balance will
  update automatically.
