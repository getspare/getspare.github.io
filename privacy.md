### PRIVACY POLICY

### Last Updated:  February 17, 2016

Spare Labs Inc (“Spare,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) respects your privacy.  This Privacy Policy sets out the manner in which Spare collects, uses, discloses and otherwise manages personal information.  This Privacy Policy applies to the privacy practices of Spare, including on our mobile application (the “App”) and on our websites available at www.sparerides.com, www.sparelabs.com, and www.spareapp.co (each, a “Website”), (together, the “Services”).

### COLLECTION AND USE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION

The term “personal information” means information about an identifiable individual, including the name, address, email address, and other information relating to an individual.  

Register:  You do not need to register to browse our Website.  However, if you want to use our App, you must register using Facebook.  When you register for the App, we will access your name, profile picture, phone number and email address from your Facebook account.  We use this information to administer your account and to communicate with you.  

If you are a driver, we may also collect your driver’s licence to confirm your ability to drive.  We will also collect information about your car including a photo, the licence plate number, car brand, model and colour.  

Communications: We may send you communications regarding new features and promotions by email, phone number or push notification.  You can unsubscribe from any of our communications by following the instructions in each of our messages or by editing the settings in your account or on your device.

Trip Information:  If you ride with Spare, we may collect your location information, such as your pick-up and drop-off address, as well as your overall route. We use the information collected in order to facilitate the communication between the users of our Service.
Ratings:  To make sure that everyone has a great experience using Spare we have implemented a rating system within the app to allow the community to self-moderate.  We will collect star ratings and comments about drivers and riders and we make those ratings available to all other App users.  

Payments:  In order to facilitate the payment of rideshare services, we (or our third-party service provider) collect the name and payment card information of riders such as payment card number and billing address.  To facilitate payment to drivers, we collect bank account information (such as the transit number, institution number and account number), as well as birth date and address.
Contact Us:  When you contact us with a comment, question or complaint, you may be asked for information that identifies you (such as your name, address and a telephone number) along with additional information we need to help us promptly answer your question or respond to your comment.  We may also retain this information to assist you in the future and to improve our customer service, and service offering.

### DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION

We will not disclose, trade, rent, sell or otherwise transfer your personal information, without your consent, except as otherwise set out herein.

### Other Users:  
Certain of your personal information may be made available to other users of the App.  For example, when searching for a ride, a rider will have access to a list of available drivers’ names and profile pictures.  Once a driver and a rider is matched, they will have access to each other’s phone numbers, their locations, their names and photos, and a description of the vehicle.
Service Provider Arrangements:

We may transfer (or otherwise make available) your personal information to third parties that provide services on our behalf.  For example, we may use service providers to authorize and process payments, host our Website and operate certain of its features.
Your personal information may be maintained and processed by us or our third party service providers in the Canada, the US, Sweden or other jurisdictions.  Our service providers are given the information they need to perform their designated functions, and we do not authorize them to use or disclose personal information for their own marketing or other purposes.

### Sale of Business:
We may transfer any information we have about you as an asset in connection with a  proposed or completed merger or sale (including transfers made as part of insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings) involving all or part of Spare or as part of a corporate reorganization or other change in corporate control.  

### Legal and Compliance:

Spare and our Canadian, US and other service providers may provide your personal information in response to a search warrant or other legally valid inquiry or order, to an organization in the case of an actual or suspected breach of an agreement or contravention of law, or as otherwise required or permitted by applicable Canadian, US or other law.
