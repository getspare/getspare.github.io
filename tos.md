      2. Drivers may not profit from any Trip. The service and the cost Contribution may only be used to discharge the Driver’s costs and may not be used to generate any profit for the Driver. The Driver is not entitled to make profit by virtue of the amount of the Trip Contribution, the types of Trips offered by a Driver, the frequency of such Trips or the number of Riders transported. This applies to all activities, arrangements and services booked using the Site and any additional services or activities which may be agreed between Driver and Rider.
      3. The Driver must not provide additional services to any Rider for profit or gain (and the Rider may not accept or ask for any such services) including (without limitation) package delivery, waiting time, additional drop offs and pick-ups and collecting additional passengers (other than the Rider).

      5. Users are reminded that using the Site in a commercial or professional capacity may invalidate a Driver’s insurance. Spare Labs’s liability is limited in accordance with these Terms and Conditions and in particular Spare Labs is not liable in respect of any breach of any agreement between Users or breach by a User of these Terms and Conditions including where any Driver (in breach of these Terms and Conditions) offers services through the Site in a professional or commercial capacity (thereby potentially invalidating their insurance). It is up to Users to be vigilant in ensuring that services are not provided on a commercial basis.
      6. Spare Labs doesn’t provide transport services. The Site is a communications platform for Users to transact with one another. Spare Labs does not interfere with Trips, destinations or timings. The agreement for Ridesharing is between the Driver and the Rider. Spare Labs is not a party to any agreement or transaction between Users, nor is Spare Labs liable in respect of any matter arising which relates to a Booking between Users. Spare Labs is not and will not act as an agent for any User.
      7. Any breach of these Terms and Conditions will give rise to immediate suspension of a User’s account and they may be restricted from accessing any further services.
   1. Rideshare service. Spare Labs offers a Rideshare service which allows Users to contact each other to arrange a Rideshare. The eligibility of a User to use the Rideshare service is to Spare Labs’s discretion and as such Spare Labs reserves the right to withdraw that service from any User at any time.
   2. Rideshare service with Bookings
      1. Conditions under which a User can use this service: Spare Labs reserves the right to withdraw the Booking service it provides and restrict it to a cohort of Users and / or only several destinations.
      2. Bookings. 
         1. The Driver proposes Trips on the Site by providing the origin and destination, date and time of departure, seats available and any other relevant information. 
         2. The Rider may book one or more seats from the Site only by performing an online payment with a valid credit card. The payment is received by Spare Labs and constitutes a Booking on the Trip. 
         3. After performing a successful Booking on a Trip, the Driver and Rider are bound to that Booking and any cancellations are subject to the Cancellations terms listed below in Section 3.10.4.
         4. The Driver and Rider are informed of the Booking by a notification through the Site. The Booking is only valid under the User’s registered name on the Site and is void under any other name. The Driver is subject, upon a Booking placed by a Rider, to complete the Trip as agreed by each party. The Driver must ensure there are enough seats in their vehicle to comfortably accommodate each and every Rider with a seatbelt.
      1. Payments and fees incurred for a Booking
         1. Booking fee
            1. In the scope of the Rideshare service with Bookings, Spare Labs collects a service fee on each Booking.
            2. The Booking fee is added during the online payment process to the Trip Contribution as specified by the Driver to cover their driving costs.
            3. The Booking fee equates to 20% of the total Trip Contribution.
         1. Payment to the Driver
            1. Once a Trip has been completed, the Driver is credited on the Site with the Contribution for the Trip’s Bookings.
            2. The Contribution from Trips is paid back to Drivers on a monthly basis. Contribution amounts are calculated between the first day and last day of each month, and transferred in the first week of the subsequent month. This can change at Spare Labs’s discretion and delays in payment might occur under extraordinary circumstances. No fees are deducted from the payment and the Driver receives 100% of the Trip Contribution.
            3. To this effect, the Driver receives funds in the form of a Paypal payment. The Driver is responsible for setting up a Paypal account to receive the funds. Paypal is the only payment form accepted. All other methods of payments are excluded from using the Spare Labs service, including cash or cheque payments. We reserve the right to add additional forms of payments in the future.
            4. Spare Labs is not responsible of any errors in payment. In particular, in the event of a fraudulent payment from a Rider placing a Booking on a Trip, Spare Labs is not liable to pay the Contribution to the Driver. The Driver agrees to transfer back any Payment in full of any Trip in the event of a fraudulent payment.
         1. Payment to the Driver
            1. It is reminded that in the scope of a Trip between a Driver and one or many Riders, the Driver must:      a) Turn up to the pick-up point on time. If the Driver fails to do so, or in the event of a cancellation, Spare Labs reserves the right to keep the information regarding the cancellation in the database and to publish that information on their User profile to indicate their reliability to other Users of the Site. Spare Labs also reserves the right to remove a User for failure to fulfil their obligations on a Trip.     b) To inform the Riders booked on a Trip of any modifications to the Trip’s details and get their permission to amend those details. If a Rider refuses a change on that Trip, they are in full right to cancel their Booking without fees and without any Contribution going towards the Driver’s costs.     c) To wait for the Rider at the pick-up point for up to 10 minutes past the agreed upon Trip time.
      1. Payment and cancellation fees. A cancellation by the Driver or the Rider after a Booking and payment have been placed is subject to the following rules:
         1. Cancellation issued by the Driver
            1. The Rider is always reimbursed 100% of the sum they paid out, including the 20% Booking fee. After three (3) “No Shows”, the Driver is no longer allowed to offer Trips on the Website.
         1. Cancellation issued by the Rider
            1. If the Rider cancels after the Trip’s scheduled departure time or does not show up within 15 minutes of the Trip’s scheduled departure time, the Driver receives the 100% of the Contribution amount and Spare Labs keeps the 20% Booking fee. No refund is granted to the Rider.
            2. In the event of a cancellation, the seats freed up by the Rider on the Trip are offered to other Users of the Site and subject to the Booking and Cancellations policies in this document.
      1. Payment process in the realm of Rideshares with Bookings
         1. Collection of payments
            1. To collect payments, the Site uses Stripe, a third-party, secure online payments gateway. Stripe is certified to PCI Service Provider Level 1, the most stringent level of certification. Your credit card information is kept safely with Stripe and no sensitive information hits the Spare Labs servers.
            2. By using Spare Labs, you agree for Stripe to securely store and retrieve your personal credit information as depicted in the Stripe terms of service.
            3. Once your money is processed with Stripe, it is deposited in a Royal Bank of Canada account under the name of Spare Labs.
         1. Interests. The payments for Contributions placed through the Site’s Booking service and owed to Drivers might accrue interests over time if they are not distributed in a timely manner. This might happen under exceptional circumstances. The User agrees never to claim any interest accrued on any payment they are due.
         2. Fraud and Identity. Users agree to respond to any demand from Spare Labs, the bank or any legal entities with regards to preventing or fighting fraud and/or money laundering. In particular, Users agree to comply with such requests by supplying valid identification documents. In the event of an immediate response to such requests, Users agree in advance to allow Spare Labs to freeze any funds they might be owed in relation to any Trips or Bookings on the Site or/and to restrict their access to the Site.
   1. Insurance
      1. The Driver takes the responsibility to insure their vehicle as per the laws in effect and to check the validity of their insurance before every Trip. The Driver must also have a valid driver’s licence.
      2. For information, it is generally accepted that Riders contributing to the cost of a Trip are covered under the terms of insurance policies in North America.
      3. It is each Driver’s and Rider’s responsibility to verify with their insurance company they are covered while Ridesharing.
      4. For Drivers with company issued vehicles, it is also their duty to check their insurance policies cover all Riders on a Ridesharing Trip.
      5. Both Driver and Rider are informed of the possibility for their insurance companies to refuse to cover the damage caused in a possible incident while using a private vehicle for commercial purposes as depicted in Section 3.1.
